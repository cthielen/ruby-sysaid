Description
===========
ruby-sysaid is a Ruby-based wrapper for the SysAid SOAP API. It abstracts
the nonsense that is dealing with SOAP in Ruby and provides a clean interface
for dealing with SysAid API objects.

Installation
============
(Tested with Ruby 1.9.3, 2.0.x, 2.1.x)

Simply type:

    gem install sysaid

If you're using Bundler add:

    gem 'sysaid'

to your Gemfile.

If you'd like to build the gem from source:

    gem build ./sysaid.gemspec
    gem install ./sysaid-*.gem

(You may have to specify the specific version above, i.e. sysaid-0.1.0.gem.)

Usage
=====

    require 'sysaid'

    SysAid::login "account", "username", "password", "wsdl_uri"

    # Find a ticket by ID and change its title

    ticket = SysAid::Ticket.find_by_id(123456)
    if ticket
      puts "Ticket found. Title is: #{ticket.title}"

      ticket.title = "My title has changed."

      if ticket.save
        puts "Ticket saved successfully."
      else
        puts "Could not save ticket."
      end
    else
      puts "Could not find ticket."
    end


    # Find all tickets by a status

    tickets = SysAid::Ticket.find_by_query("status IN (1, 2, 3)")
    if tickets
      puts "Found #{tickets.length} tickets."
    else
      puts "Could not find any tickets."
    end



    # Create user 'deleteme' if he doesn't exist, delete him if he does

    user = SysAid::User.find_by_username('deleteme')
    unless user
      puts "Could not find user 'deleteme'. Creating..."

      user = SysAid::User.new('deleteme')
      if user.save
        puts "User saved successfully"
      else
        puts "Could not save user"
      end
    else
      puts "User 'deleteme' found. Deleting."

      user.delete
    end

    # You could also have changed the user's name, e.g.
    # user.first_name = "Don't Delete"
    # user.save


    # Find IDs of projects whose status = 2 (2 = Active)
    projects = SysAid::Project.find_by_query("status=2")

    if projects
      puts "== These projects are ACTIVE =="
      projects.each do |proj_id|
        project = SysAid::Project.find_by_id(proj_id)

        puts project.title
      end
    end


    # Find IDs of tasks whose project_id = 25
    tasks = SysAid::Task.find_by_project_id(25)

    if tasks
      puts "== These tasks are in project 25 =="
      tasks.each do |task_id|
        task = SysAid::Tasks.find_by_id(task_id)

        puts task.title
      end
    end


    # Find all activities related to ticket ID 12345
    activity_ids = SysAid::Activity.find_by_ticket_id("12345")

    if activity_ids
      activity_ids.each do |activity_id|
        activity = SysAid::Activity.find_by_id(activity_id)
        puts activity.description
      end
    end


Error Handling
==============
ruby-sysaid will throw a SysAidException exception on any problems it catches.

It is recommended you wrap all your SysAid code with a check for this exception, e.g.

    begin
        activity_ids = SysAid::Activity.find_by_ticket_id("12345")
    rescue SysAidException => e
        puts "SysAid error: #{e.message}"
    end
